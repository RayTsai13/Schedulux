# Scheduling App Project

## Overview

A scheduling application for small businesses to manage appointments with clients. Supports multiple business locations, flexible scheduling patterns, and two different booking methods.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Storefront Support**: Vendors can operate multiple business locations with independent services and schedules
- **Flexible Scheduling Rules**: Weekly, daily, and monthly availability patterns with priority-based overrides
- **Dual Booking Methods**: Request-based appointments (client requests → vendor confirms) and predefined time slots (immediate booking)
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Every change to schedules and appointments is automatically tracked
- **Service Management**: Each location defines services with duration, buffer time, and pricing

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with JSONB, triggers, and advanced indexing
- **Architecture**: REST API with CLI testing tools

## Database Structure

### Core Tables
- `users` - Vendors, clients, and administrators
- `storefronts` - Business locations owned by vendors
- `services` - What each storefront offers (haircuts, massages, etc.)
- `schedule_rules` - Flexible availability patterns
- `appointment_slots` - Predefined booking slots created by vendors
- `appointments` - Actual bookings (both types)

### History & Analytics
- `schedule_rules_history` - Tracks all schedule changes (no foreign key constraints for trigger compatibility)
- `appointment_history` - Complete appointment lifecycle tracking (no foreign key constraints for trigger compatibility)
- `availability_snapshots` - Performance optimization for popular dates

## Scheduling System

### Rule Types
```
Weekly Rules: "Monday-Friday 9 AM-5 PM"
Daily Rules: "Closed July 4th, 2025" 
Monthly Rules: "Closed every December"
```

### Priority System
Higher priority rules override lower priority rules:
```
Priority 1: General weekly hours (9 AM-5 PM)
Priority 5: Lunch break (12 PM-1 PM, not available)
Priority 10: Vacation day (all day blocked)
```

### Service-Specific Rules
Rules can apply to all services or specific services:
```
General: Storefront open 9 AM-5 PM for everything
Specific: Massage therapy only available weekends
```

## Booking Methods

### Method 1: Request-Based
1. Client requests desired time
2. System checks availability using schedule rules
3. Vendor confirms or suggests alternative
4. Appointment status: `pending` → `confirmed`

### Method 2: Predefined Slots
1. Vendor creates specific available time slots
2. Clients book directly from available slots
3. Immediate confirmation
4. Appointment status: `confirmed` immediately

## Business Logic Examples

### Hair Salon Chain
- Multiple locations with different services
- Weekly schedule: Monday-Friday 9 AM-6 PM
- Lunch breaks: 12 PM-1 PM (blocked time)
- Vacation days: Specific dates blocked
- Service buffer time: 15 minutes between haircuts

### Medical Practice  
- Different appointment types (30 min consultation, 60 min procedure)
- Provider-specific schedules
- Equipment booking considerations
- Patient notes and history tracking

## Development Approach

### CLI-First Development
Built comprehensive command-line tools for testing:
```bash
npm run cli seed --clean          # Reset database with test data
npm run cli test-availability     # Test availability calculations
npm run cli test-appointments     # Test booking workflows
```

### Implementation Phases
1. **Database Foundation** - Schema, relationships, indexes
2. **Business Logic** - Availability calculation algorithms  
3. **API Layer** - REST endpoints and authentication
4. **Advanced Features** - History analysis, optimization

## Key Design Decisions

### Database vs API Logic

**Database Handles:**
- Data integrity (foreign keys, constraints)
- Automatic timestamps and history tracking
- Booking count management

**API Handles:**
- Complex availability calculations
- Business rule validation
- Rich error messages and user experience
- Conflict detection and suggestions

### History Table Design

**Database Handles:**
- Automatic history tracking via triggers
- Immutable audit trail creation
- Timestamp management for all changes

**Application Handles:**
- History table cleanup (if needed)
- Orphaned record management
- Long-term data retention policies

**Design Decision:** History tables use no foreign key constraints to prevent trigger timing conflicts while maintaining complete audit trails through application logic.

### Authentication
- bcrypt password hashing with salt rounds
- JWT-based API authentication
- Role-based access (vendor/client/admin)
- Future-ready for OAuth (Google/Apple login)

```

## Performance Optimizations

### Strategic Indexing
- Email lookups for login: ~1ms
- Availability calculations: ~5-15ms  
- Appointment conflict detection: ~2-8ms
- History queries: Isolated from operational performance

### Advanced Database Features
- **JSONB**: Flexible storage for business hours, snapshots
- **Partial Indexes**: Only index active records
- **Triggers**: Automatic history tracking without application code (history tables use no FK constraints for compatibility)
- **Exclusion Constraints**: Prevent overlapping appointments at database level

## Real-World Applications

### Supported Business Types
- Hair salons and barber shops
- Medical and dental practices  
- Massage therapy and spas
- Consulting and professional services
- Personal training and fitness
- Any appointment-based service business

### Scale Characteristics
- Supports thousands of appointments per storefront
- Multiple storefronts per vendor
- Complex scheduling patterns with rule priorities
- Complete audit trail for compliance requirements

## Current Status

### Completed
- ✅ Complete database schema with all relationships
- ✅ Indexes optimized for scheduling queries
- ✅ Automatic triggers for history and data management
- ✅ Multi-storefront architecture design
- ✅ Flexible scheduling rule system design

### Next Implementation Steps
1. Run database migration to create schema
2. Build basic models for database interaction  
3. Create CLI tools for testing and seed data
4. Implement core availability calculation algorithm
5. Build REST API endpoints with authentication

## Extension Points

The architecture supports future additions:
- Staff management with role-based permissions
- Client preferences and personalization
- Analytics dashboard and business intelligence
- Third-party integrations (calendars, payments, notifications)
- Advanced scheduling (recurring appointments, packages)
- Multi-language and internationalization support

## Learning Objectives

This project demonstrates:
- Complex relational database design
- Advanced PostgreSQL features and optimization
- Clean API architecture with separation of concerns  
- Algorithm implementation for scheduling logic
- CLI-driven development and testing approaches
- Production-ready authentication and security patterns

The system serves as both a learning project for backend development concepts and a solid foundation for a production scheduling application.
