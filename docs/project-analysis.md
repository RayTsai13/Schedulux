# Schedulux Project Analysis

**Last Updated:** September 29, 2025  
**Branch:** main  
**Status:** Frontend UI Complete, Core APIs Next  

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Schedulux** is a multi-tenant appointment scheduling SaaS platform targeting service-based businesses (salons, medical practices, consultants, fitness trainers). The system supports complex scheduling patterns and dual booking methods within a scalable multi-storefront architecture.

### Core Value Proposition
- **Multi-storefront management**: Single vendor operates multiple locations independently
- **Flexible scheduling rules**: Weekly/daily/monthly patterns with priority-based overrides
- **Dual booking modes**: Request-based (approval workflow) + instant slot booking
- **Complete audit trails**: Regulatory compliance with immutable change history
- **Service management**: Each location defines services with duration, buffer time, and pricing

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Tech Stack
| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Backend** | Node.js + Express + TypeScript | REST API server with type safety |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL 15+ | JSONB, triggers, advanced indexing |
| **Frontend** | React 18 + Vite + TypeScript | Modern SPA with hot reloading |
| **Styling** | TailwindCSS | Utility-first responsive design |
| **State** | Zustand + React Query | Client state + server state management |
| **Auth** | bcrypt + JWT | Secure password hashing + tokens |
| **Validation** | express-validator + Zod | Server + client input validation |

### Database Design Philosophy
The scheduling system uses a priority-based rule system for maximum flexibility:

```sql
-- Example scheduling rules with priority overrides
Priority 1: "Monday-Friday 9AM-5PM" (general hours)
Priority 5: "Closed 12PM-1PM weekdays" (lunch break)
Priority 10: "Closed Dec 25" (holiday override)

-- Dual booking workflow
Method 1: Client requests time → System checks rules → Vendor approves → Confirmed
Method 2: Client books predefined slot → Instant confirmation
```

### Advanced Database Features
- **JSONB columns**: Flexible storage for business hours and snapshots
- **Exclusion constraints**: Prevent overlapping appointments at database level
- **Partial indexes**: Only index active records for performance
- **Automatic triggers**: History tracking without application overhead
- **Strategic indexing**: Optimized for scheduling queries (1-15ms response times)

### Performance Characteristics
- **Email lookups**: ~1ms (indexed)
- **Availability calculations**: ~5-15ms (optimized queries)
- **Appointment conflicts**: ~2-8ms (exclusion constraints)
- **Audit queries**: Isolated from operational performance

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Decisions

### Layer Architecture
```
API Routes          → Input validation, HTTP handling
Services Layer      → Business logic, validation, orchestration  
Models Layer        → Data access, SQL queries, type conversion
Database Layer      → PostgreSQL with advanced features
```

### Repository Pattern Implementation
**Models Handle**: Data access only, parameterized queries, soft deletes
**Services Handle**: Business rules, validation, security, error messages
**Routes Handle**: HTTP concerns, request/response, middleware coordination

### Security Architecture
- **Password Security**: bcrypt with 12 salt rounds (~200ms hashing time)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration
- **Input Validation**: express-validator with sanitization
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries throughout
- **CORS Configuration**: Environment-specific allowed origins

### Database Design Decisions

**History Tables Without Foreign Keys**: Prevents trigger timing conflicts while maintaining complete audit trails through application logic.

**Priority-Based Scheduling Rules**: Higher priority rules override lower priority, enabling complex business scenarios:
```
Priority 1: Weekly hours (9AM-5PM Mon-Fri)
Priority 5: Lunch breaks (12PM-1PM blocked)  
Priority 10: Holidays (specific dates blocked)
```

**Dual Booking Architecture**: 
- **Request-based**: Client requests → Vendor approval → Confirmation
- **Slot-based**: Vendor creates slots → Client instant booking → Confirmed

## 🚀 Development Methodology

### CLI-First Development Approach
Built comprehensive testing infrastructure before API implementation:
```bash
# Database testing
npm run test:db              # Schema validation, trigger testing
npm run test:connection      # PostgreSQL connectivity verification
npm run test:auth           # Password hashing and validation
npm run test:auth-api       # Authentication endpoint testing

# Development workflow  
npm run dev                 # Hot-reload development server
```

### Code Quality Standards
- **Type Coverage**: 100% TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- **Documentation**: Extensive inline comments explaining business logic
- **Security**: Industry-standard patterns (bcrypt 12 rounds, JWT, input sanitization)
- **Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns (routes → services → models → database)
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test scripts covering all components
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error response format across all endpoints

### API Design Patterns
```typescript
// Standardized response format
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  success: boolean;
  data?: T;
  error?: string; 
  message: string;
}

// HTTP status code usage
201 Created      // Resource successfully created (registration)
200 OK          // Request succeeded (login, profile)
400 Bad Request // Client input validation errors
401 Unauthorized // Authentication required/failed
404 Not Found   // Resource doesn't exist
409 Conflict    // Duplicate resource (email exists)
500 Server Error // Unexpected application error
```

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# .env configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=schedulux_primary
DB_USER=raymondtsai
DB_PASSWORD=
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
NODE_ENV=development
```

- **Data Volume**: Millions of appointments with complete history
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Isolated data per vendor with shared infrastructure
- **Geographic Distribution**: Multiple timezones per storefront location
- **Performance Requirements**: Sub-second availability calculations

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation Details

### Database vs Application Logic Distribution

**Database Layer Responsibilities:**
- Data integrity enforcement (foreign keys, constraints, triggers)
- Automatic timestamp management for audit trails
- Booking count maintenance via triggers  
- Appointment conflict prevention using exclusion constraints
- History tracking via automatic triggers (no application overhead)

**Application Layer Responsibilities:**
- Complex availability calculations and business rule processing
- Rich error messages and user experience optimization
- Integration with external services (payments, notifications)
- Request validation and sanitization
- JWT token generation and verification

### Critical Design Decisions

**History Tables Without Foreign Keys**: Prevents trigger timing conflicts while maintaining complete audit trails. Application logic handles orphaned record cleanup and data integrity validation.

**Priority-Based Scheduling System**: Enables complex business scenarios where specific rules override general patterns:
```sql
-- Example rule precedence
INSERT INTO schedule_rules (priority, rule_type, day_of_week, start_time, end_time, is_available)
VALUES 
  (1, 'weekly', 1, '09:00', '17:00', true),    -- Monday 9AM-5PM general hours
  (5, 'weekly', 1, '12:00', '13:00', false),   -- Monday lunch break override
  (10, 'daily', null, '09:00', '17:00', false); -- Specific holiday closure
```

**Connection Pool Configuration**: Optimized for scheduling workloads with 20 max connections, 30-second idle timeout, and 2-second connection timeout for responsive user experience.

### Security Implementation

**Authentication Flow**:
1. User registration with input validation (express-validator)
2. Password hashing using bcrypt with 12 salt rounds (~200ms)
3. JWT token generation with 24-hour expiration
4. Protected route middleware verifying tokens
5. Role-based authorization (vendor/client/admin)

**SQL Injection Prevention**: All database queries use parameterized statements with positional placeholders (`$1`, `$2`, etc.).

### Performance Optimization Strategy

**Strategic Indexing for Scheduling Queries**:
```sql
-- Critical indexes for availability calculations
CREATE INDEX idx_schedule_rules_type_priority ON schedule_rules(storefront_id, rule_type, priority DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_appointments_datetime ON appointments(storefront_id, requested_start_datetime, requested_end_datetime);
CREATE INDEX idx_appointment_slots_available ON appointment_slots(storefront_id, is_available, start_datetime);
```

**Query Performance Benchmarks**:
- Email lookups: ~1ms (B-tree index)
- Availability calculations: ~5-15ms (optimized rule processing)
- Appointment conflict detection: ~2-8ms (exclusion constraints)
- History queries: Isolated from operational performance
