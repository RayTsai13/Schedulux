/**
 * Database Configuration Module
 * 
 * This module implements PostgreSQL database connectivity using connection pooling,
 * which is essential for production applications because:
 * 
 * Connection Pooling Benefits:
 * - Reuses existing connections instead of creating new ones for each query
 * - Prevents connection exhaustion under high load
 * - Reduces latency (connection setup is expensive)
 * - Manages connection lifecycle automatically
 * - Provides connection timeout and retry mechanisms
 * 
 * Security Features:
 * - Loads sensitive credentials from environment variables
 * - Never hardcodes database passwords in source code
 * - Uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
 * 
 * Production Considerations:
 * - Connection pool limits prevent database overload
 * - Automatic connection cleanup prevents memory leaks
 * - Error handling and graceful shutdown procedures
 * - Query performance monitoring and logging

/**
 * PostgreSQL Database Connection Configuration
 * 
 * This configuration object defines how our application connects to PostgreSQL.
 * It uses environment variables for security and flexibility across different
 * deployment environments (development, staging, production).
 * 
 * Environment Variable Strategy:
 * - DB_HOST: Database server hostname (localhost for development)
 * - DB_PORT: PostgreSQL port (default 5432)
 * - DB_NAME: Database name (schedulux_primary)
 * - DB_USER: Database username
 * - DB_PASSWORD: Database password (should be set in .env file)
 * 
 * Connection Pool Configuration:
 * - max: Maximum concurrent connections (20 is good for small-medium apps)
 * - idleTimeoutMillis: How long to keep unused connections (30 seconds)
 * - connectionTimeoutMillis: How long to wait for new connections (2 seconds)
 * 
 * These settings balance performance with resource usage and prevent
 * overwhelming the database server.

/**
 * PostgreSQL Connection Pool Instance
 * 
 * This pool manages database connections for the entire application.
 * Instead of creating a new connection for each query (expensive and slow),
 * the pool maintains a set of reusable connections.
 * 
 * How Connection Pooling Works:
 * 1. Pool pre-creates connections when the app starts
 * 2. When a query needs to run, it borrows a connection from the pool
 * 3. After the query completes, the connection returns to the pool
 * 4. Idle connections are cleaned up automatically
 * 
 * Benefits:
 * - Much faster than creating new connections
 * - Prevents connection exhaustion under load
 * - Automatically handles connection failures and retries
 * - Provides monitoring and metrics
 * 
 * This pool instance is shared across all models and services in the application.

/**
 * Connection Success Handler
 * 
 * This event fires every time a new connection is successfully established
 * to the PostgreSQL database. It provides confirmation that:
 * - Database server is reachable
 * - Credentials are correct
 * - Network connectivity is working
 * - Database is accepting connections
 * 
 * In production, you might want to reduce this logging or send it to
 * a monitoring system instead of console output.

/**
 * Connection Error Handler
 * 
 * This event fires when the connection pool encounters an error.
 * Common causes include:
 * - Database server is down
 * - Wrong connection credentials
 * - Network connectivity issues
 * - Database is at connection limit
 * - Firewall blocking connection
 * 
 * The process.exit(-1) ensures the application stops completely rather
 * than continuing in a broken state without database access.
 * In production, you might want more sophisticated error handling.

/**
 * Database Query Helper Function
 * 
 * @param text - The SQL query string with optional parameter placeholders ($1, $2, etc.)
 * @param params - Array of values to substitute for placeholders (optional)
 * @returns Promise<QueryResult> - PostgreSQL query result object
 * 
 * This helper function provides a standardized way to execute database queries
 * throughout the application. It adds several important features on top of
 * the basic pool.query() method:
 * 
 * Performance Monitoring:
 * - Measures query execution time for performance analysis
 * - Logs query details for debugging and optimization
 * - Tracks row counts for result validation
 * 
 * Security Features:
 * - Supports parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
 * - Automatically escapes parameter values
 * - Separates SQL structure from data values
 * 
 * Usage Examples:
 * 
 * Simple query (no parameters):
 * const result = await query('SELECT * FROM users');
 * 
 * Parameterized query (safe from SQL injection):
 * const result = await query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [userId]);
 * 
 * Complex query with multiple parameters:
 * const result = await query(
 *   'UPDATE users SET name = $1, email = $2 WHERE id = $3',
 *   [name, email, userId]
 * );
 * 
 * The function is used by all repository classes (UserModel, StorefrontModel)
 * to maintain consistent database access patterns across the application.

/**
 * Graceful Application Shutdown Handler
 * 
 * This process event handler ensures that database connections are properly
 * closed when the application is shutting down. This is critical for:
 * 
 * Resource Cleanup:
 * - Prevents hanging connections in PostgreSQL
 * - Releases memory and file descriptors
 * - Ensures clean application termination
 * 
 * Production Deployment:
 * - Allows process managers (PM2, Docker, Kubernetes) to restart cleanly
 * - Prevents connection leaks during deployments
 * - Maintains database connection limits under control
 * 
 * Signal Handling:
 * - SIGINT: Interrupt signal (Ctrl+C during development)
 * - SIGTERM: Termination signal (sent by process managers)
 * - Graceful shutdown: Application finishes current operations before stopping
 * 
 * The shutdown process:
 * 1. Receive shutdown signal
 * 2. Stop accepting new database queries
 * 3. Wait for pending queries to complete
 * 4. Close all pool connections
 * 5. Exit process cleanly
 * 
 * This prevents the "connection terminated unexpectedly" errors that can
 * occur when applications are forcefully killed.
